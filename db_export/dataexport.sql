INSERT INTO `genres` VALUES (1,'History','History is one of the three main genres in Western theatre alongside tragedy and comedy, although it originated, in its modern form, thousands of years later than the other primary genres. For this reason, it is often treated as a subset of tragedy. A play in this genre is known as a history play and is based on a historical narrative, often set in the medieval or early modern past. History emerged as a distinct genre from tragedy in Renaissance England.It is a field of research which uses a narrative to examine and analyse the sequence of events, and it sometimes attempts to investigate objectively the patterns of cause and effect that determine events.'),(2,'Mystery','Mystery fiction is a loosely-defined term that is often used as a synonym of detective fiction — in other words a novel or short story in which a detective (either professional or amateur) solves a crime. The term \"mystery fiction\" may sometimes be limited to the subset of detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle element and its logical solution (cf. whodunit), as a contrast to hardboiled detective stories which focus on action and gritty realism. However, in more general usage \"mystery\" may be used to describe any form of crime fiction, even if there is no mystery to be solved. For example, the Mystery Writers of America describes itself as \"the premier organization for mystery writers, professionals allied to the crime writing field, aspiring crime writers, and those who are devoted to the genre\".'),(3,'Psychology',' Books in the psychology nonfiction genre are about the applied discipline that involves the scientific study of mental function and behaviors. The books in this genre deal with the science of understanding individuals’ mind functions in an attempt to benefit society. They attempt to tackle the understanding of the inner mind and apply treatments to improve roles of social, behavioral, and cognitive health.'),(4,'Romance','According to the Romance Writers of America, \"Two basic elements comprise every romance novel: a central love story and an emotionally-satisfying and optimistic ending.\" Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters\' romantic love. Other definitions of a romance novel may be broader, including other plots and endings or more than two people, or narrower, restricting the types of romances or conflicts.'),(5,'Self-Help','Self-help, or self-improvement, is a self-guided improvement—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial psychological basis. Many different self-help groupings exist and each has its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. \"Self-help culture, particularly Twelve-Step culture, has provided some of our most robust new language: recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency.'),(6,'Spirituality','Book in the spirituality nonfiction genre are about the belief and processes of personal transformation involved with believing in a power greater than one’s self, over the universe. The books in this genre involve techniques and journeys about finding and believing in something beyond one’s self, and becoming linked with something bigger (a god or deity). They don’t necessarily have to do with religion, because spirituality is often separated from (but sometimes connected with) religion in that it’s based on subjective experience and psychological growth.'),(7,'Thriller','Thrillers are characterized by fast pacing, frequent action, and resourceful heroes who must thwart the plans of more-powerful and better-equipped villains. Literary devices such as suspense, red herrings and cliffhangers are used extensively. Thrillers often overlap with mystery stories, but are distinguished by the structure of their plots. In a thriller, the hero must thwart the plans of an enemy, rather than uncover a crime that has already happened. Thrillers also occur on a much grander scale: the crimes that must be prevented are serial or mass murder, terrorism, assassination, or the overthrow of governments. Jeopardy and violent confrontations are standard plot elements. While a mystery climaxes when the mystery is solved, a thriller climaxes when the hero finally defeats the villain, saving his own life and often the lives of others.'),(8,'Young Adult','Young-adult fiction, whether in the form of novels or short stories, has distinct attributes that distinguish it from the other age categories of fiction. The vast majority of YA stories portray an adolescent as the protagonist, rather than an adult or a child. The subject matter and story lines are typically consistent with the age and experience of the main character, but beyond that YA stories span the entire spectrum of fiction genres. The settings of YA stories are limited only by the imagination and skill of the author. Themes in YA stories often focus on the challenges of youth, so much so that the entire age category is sometimes referred to as problem novels or coming of age novel. '),(9,'Drama','The drama genre is strongly based in a character, or characters, that are in conflict at a crucial moment in their lives. Most dramas revolve around families and often have tragic or painful resolutions. Drama depends a lot on realistic characters dealing with emotional themes, such as: alcoholism, drug addiction, infidelity, morals, racism, religion, intolerance, sexuality, poverty, class issues, violence, and corruption (society or natural disasters can even be thrown in from time to time). Drama often crosses over and meshes with other genres.'),(10,'Horror','Horror fiction is fiction in any medium intended to scare, unsettle, or horrify the audience. Historically, the cause of the \"horror\" experience has often been the intrusion of a supernatural element into everyday human experience. Since the 1960s, any work of fiction with a morbid, gruesome, surreal, or exceptionally suspenseful or frightening theme has come to be called \"horror\". Horror fiction often overlaps science fiction or fantasy, all three of which categories are sometimes placed under the umbrella classification speculative fiction.'),(11,'Fiction','Fiction is the telling of stories which are not real. More specifically, fiction is an imaginative form of narrative, one of the four basic rhetorical modes. Although the word fiction is derived from the Latin fingo, fingere, finxi, fictum, \"to form, create\", works of fiction need not be entirely imaginary and may include real people, places, and events. Fiction may be either written or oral. Although not all fiction is necessarily artistic, fiction is largely perceived as a form of art or entertainment. The ability to create fiction and other artistic works is considered to be a fundamental aspect of human culture, one of the defining characteristics of humanity.'),(12,'Fantasy','Fantasy is a genre that uses magic and other supernatural forms as a primary element of plot, theme, and/or setting. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of technological and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (collectively known as speculative fiction or science fiction/fantasy).In its broadest sense, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today, including young adults, most of whom are represented by the works below. '),(13,'Autobiography','Autobiography is a style of writing that has been around nearly as long as history has been recorded. Yet autobiography was not classified as a genre within itself until the late eighteenth century. Most autobiographies are written from the first person singular perspective. This is fitting because autobiography is usually a story one tells about oneself. It would not naturally follow then that the writer would recount his or her past from a second or third person perspective. The author, the narrator, and the protagonist must share a common identity for the work to be considered an autobiography.'),(14,'Detective',' Books in the detective genre are about a detective, or detectives – either a professional or amateur – who is involved in solving a crime. The detective sometimes has to figure out how the crime was actually pulled off/committed in order to solve the case. The plot follows the detective as they discover clues that lead to the apprehension of the criminal. The detective genre is closely linked and similar to the crime and mystery genres.'),(15,'Crime','The crime genre includes the broad selection of books on criminals and the court system, but the most common focus is investigations and sleuthing. Mystery novels are usually placed into this category, although there is a separate division for \"crime\". It  involves a crime in some way: a crime being committed, or having been committed. A crime story can also be about a criminal’s life. Often crime fiction crosses over or meshes with the suspense, thriller, detective, mystery, action, and/or adventure genres. '),(16,'',NULL);

So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head.

INSERT INTO `genres` VALUES (1,'History','History is one of the three main genres in Western theatre alongside tragedy and comedy, although it originated, in its modern form, thousands of years later than the other primary genres. For this reason, it is often treated as a subset of tragedy. A play in this genre is known as a history play and is based on a historical narrative, often set in the medieval or early modern past. History emerged as a distinct genre from tragedy in Renaissance England.It is a field of research which uses a narrative to examine and analyse the sequence of events, and it sometimes attempts to investigate objectively the patterns of cause and effect that determine events.'),(2,'Mystery','Mystery fiction is a loosely-defined term that is often used as a synonym of detective fiction — in other words a novel or short story in which a detective (either professional or amateur) solves a crime. The term \"mystery fiction\" may sometimes be limited to the subset of detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle element and its logical solution (cf. whodunit), as a contrast to hardboiled detective stories which focus on action and gritty realism. However, in more general usage \"mystery\" may be used to describe any form of crime fiction, even if there is no mystery to be solved. For example, the Mystery Writers of America describes itself as \"the premier organization for mystery writers, professionals allied to the crime writing field, aspiring crime writers, and those who are devoted to the genre\".'),(3,'Psychology',' Books in the psychology nonfiction genre are about the applied discipline that involves the scientific study of mental function and behaviors. The books in this genre deal with the science of understanding individuals’ mind functions in an attempt to benefit society. They attempt to tackle the understanding of the inner mind and apply treatments to improve roles of social, behavioral, and cognitive health.'),(4,'Romance','According to the Romance Writers of America, \"Two basic elements comprise every romance novel: a central love story and an emotionally-satisfying and optimistic ending.\" Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters\' romantic love. Other definitions of a romance novel may be broader, including other plots and endings or more than two people, or narrower, restricting the types of romances or conflicts.'),(5,'Self-Help','Self-help, or self-improvement, is a self-guided improvement—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial psychological basis. Many different self-help groupings exist and each has its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. \"Self-help culture, particularly Twelve-Step culture, has provided some of our most robust new language: recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency.'),(6,'Spirituality','Book in the spirituality nonfiction genre are about the belief and processes of personal transformation involved with believing in a power greater than one’s self, over the universe. The books in this genre involve techniques and journeys about finding and believing in something beyond one’s self, and becoming linked with something bigger (a god or deity). They don’t necessarily have to do with religion, because spirituality is often separated from (but sometimes connected with) religion in that it’s based on subjective experience and psychological growth.'),(7,'Thriller','Thrillers are characterized by fast pacing, frequent action, and resourceful heroes who must thwart the plans of more-powerful and better-equipped villains. Literary devices such as suspense, red herrings and cliffhangers are used extensively. Thrillers often overlap with mystery stories, but are distinguished by the structure of their plots. In a thriller, the hero must thwart the plans of an enemy, rather than uncover a crime that has already happened. Thrillers also occur on a much grander scale: the crimes that must be prevented are serial or mass murder, terrorism, assassination, or the overthrow of governments. Jeopardy and violent confrontations are standard plot elements. While a mystery climaxes when the mystery is solved, a thriller climaxes when the hero finally defeats the villain, saving his own life and often the lives of others.'),(8,'Young Adult','Young-adult fiction, whether in the form of novels or short stories, has distinct attributes that distinguish it from the other age categories of fiction. The vast majority of YA stories portray an adolescent as the protagonist, rather than an adult or a child. The subject matter and story lines are typically consistent with the age and experience of the main character, but beyond that YA stories span the entire spectrum of fiction genres. The settings of YA stories are limited only by the imagination and skill of the author. Themes in YA stories often focus on the challenges of youth, so much so that the entire age category is sometimes referred to as problem novels or coming of age novel. '),(9,'Drama','The drama genre is strongly based in a character, or characters, that are in conflict at a crucial moment in their lives. Most dramas revolve around families and often have tragic or painful resolutions. Drama depends a lot on realistic characters dealing with emotional themes, such as: alcoholism, drug addiction, infidelity, morals, racism, religion, intolerance, sexuality, poverty, class issues, violence, and corruption (society or natural disasters can even be thrown in from time to time). Drama often crosses over and meshes with other genres.'),(10,'Horror','Horror fiction is fiction in any medium intended to scare, unsettle, or horrify the audience. Historically, the cause of the \"horror\" experience has often been the intrusion of a supernatural element into everyday human experience. Since the 1960s, any work of fiction with a morbid, gruesome, surreal, or exceptionally suspenseful or frightening theme has come to be called \"horror\". Horror fiction often overlaps science fiction or fantasy, all three of which categories are sometimes placed under the umbrella classification speculative fiction.'),(11,'Fiction','Fiction is the telling of stories which are not real. More specifically, fiction is an imaginative form of narrative, one of the four basic rhetorical modes. Although the word fiction is derived from the Latin fingo, fingere, finxi, fictum, \"to form, create\", works of fiction need not be entirely imaginary and may include real people, places, and events. Fiction may be either written or oral. Although not all fiction is necessarily artistic, fiction is largely perceived as a form of art or entertainment. The ability to create fiction and other artistic works is considered to be a fundamental aspect of human culture, one of the defining characteristics of humanity.'),(12,'Fantasy','Fantasy is a genre that uses magic and other supernatural forms as a primary element of plot, theme, and/or setting. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of technological and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (collectively known as speculative fiction or science fiction/fantasy).In its broadest sense, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today, including young adults, most of whom are represented by the works below. '),(13,'Autobiography','Autobiography is a style of writing that has been around nearly as long as history has been recorded. Yet autobiography was not classified as a genre within itself until the late eighteenth century. Most autobiographies are written from the first person singular perspective. This is fitting because autobiography is usually a story one tells about oneself. It would not naturally follow then that the writer would recount his or her past from a second or third person perspective. The author, the narrator, and the protagonist must share a common identity for the work to be considered an autobiography.'),(14,'Detective',' Books in the detective genre are about a detective, or detectives – either a professional or amateur – who is involved in solving a crime. The detective sometimes has to figure out how the crime was actually pulled off/committed in order to solve the case. The plot follows the detective as they discover clues that lead to the apprehension of the criminal. The detective genre is closely linked and similar to the crime and mystery genres.'),(15,'Crime','The crime genre includes the broad selection of books on criminals and the court system, but the most common focus is investigations and sleuthing. Mystery novels are usually placed into this category, although there is a separate division for \"crime\". It  involves a crime in some way: a crime being committed, or having been committed. A crime story can also be about a criminal’s life. Often crime fiction crosses over or meshes with the suspense, thriller, detective, mystery, action, and/or adventure genres. '),(16,'',NULL);
